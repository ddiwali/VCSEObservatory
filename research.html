                    Measure your wellbeing impact
A practical guide for charities and social enterprises
Whether you want to improve health, education or employment, measuring wellbeing can show you the wider impact you have on the people and communities you support.

This guide was designed for people who may have lots of different functions in an organisation, with very busy working days. The guide allows you to dip in and out of the content as you need, and work at your own pace.
