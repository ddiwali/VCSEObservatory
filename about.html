        <p class="par">In the era of big data, leveraged data analytics to make informed decisions, and forecast future trends is becoming increasingly important. However, the Voluntary, Community, and Social Enterprise (VCSE) sector remains behind due to the lack of accurate, reliable, and timely data. Indeed data poverty is widely recognised as being longstanding problem within the VCSE sector (The Young Foundation, 2021; MacLaughlin, 2016; Mercer, 2019). In contrast to the business sector, which has multiple long-standing surveys, such as the ESRC Decision Maker panel (ESRC, 2022) and numerous recognised health indicators, equivalents within the VCSE sector do not exist (Abramson, 2022). A recent landmark report states in “contrast to the private sector” the VCSE sector struggles to produce “recognised, reliable, and timely data”, making it “difficult for government to develop long-term strategies that enable the sector to maximise its potential” (Kenley and Wilding, 2021). 
            The previous Minister responsible for Civil Society Nigel Huddleston has called for better “data and information and evidence” to make “a case for the sector in government” (Wait, 2022), the Kruger report claimed sector data is “substandard”, and called to “agree a means of accurately measuring civil society activity and value” (Kruger, 2020). Ed Humpherson, head of the Office for Statistics Regulation argues “the absence of data about civil society means there is a significant gap in our understanding of what is happening, how organisations are faring, and where resources are needed most”. Consequently the sector is unable to articulate its capacity and needs to policy-makers, and funders, who in turn lack data to decide where to place limited resources. This need is recognised by DCMS National Data Strategy, which has identified improving sector data as a key strategic priority.
            The implications are significant. The true size of the sector is underestimated, contributing to the sector being overlooked by policy-makers. The sector also struggles to articulate the value it creates, meaning that “the sector’s activities is often far greater than the cost to funders” (Pro Bono Economics, 2023) meaning its activities are under valued and VCSE organisations themselves have little data to inform their decision-making, meaning decisions are often made in the dark.
            Yet while there is ‘data poverty’ in the sector, we argue the problem is also ‘data fragmentation’. The sector has multiple surveys, has data collection around its impact, and need to report to funders, foundations, and other agencies. Yet this data is disjointed and fragmented, with organisations asking for similar information, but in different ways, making data hard to collect, compare and analyse, whilst at the same time organisations are burdened by high demands from different organisations for their data.
            It is to tackle this gap that the VCSE Data and Insights Observatory was established. The Observatory  does this by gathering, analysing, and interpreting data on the voluntary, community and social enterprise sector (VCSE) in the UK. Its primary purpose is to monitor, study, and understand trends, and patterns, and to visualise data in a way that uncovers new insights, and promotes the communication of complex data sets in ways that inform policy-makers, funders and foundations, infrastructure organisations and practitioners. Thus the Observatory will provide a trusted, independent source of interactive intelligence for policy-makers, infrastructure and frontline organisations and researchers. 
           <br> The observatory gathers data from various sources which fits into four categories

            <br>1.	Existing data about the sector such as government statistics, administrative data (held by regulators such the Charity Commission or Companies House), data held by local infrastructure organisations; 
            <br>2.	Observatory generating its own data, such as the VCSE Barometer which is the largest national quarterly survey of the sector run in conjunction with 14 national organisations
            <br>3.	Develops new data sources into the sector, such as bank transaction data with Experian on charitable giving. 
            <br>4.	Developing platforms for data collection by other organisations in a more unified way.
            
            <br>The Observatory’s ambition is to empower the sector to be able to analyse existing data and generate new data in ways that are consistent, trustworthy and comparable. The Observatory aims to create comparable data, reduce duplication, increase capacity, through the development of useful tools and resources, and build capability to support organisational decision-makers and analysts, placing data and evidence at the heart of decision-making. It will do this through create tools and resources to make better use of existing data and methodologies that will be recognised by key decision-makers, to create a common framework for decision-making about the sector.
            The Observatory has developed strong links with a series of Stakeholders including the Bank of England (with whom we have a MOU) including a visit by the Deputy Governor, DCMS – presenting data from the Quarterly Barometer and working on supporting the DCMS sponsored civil society stakeholder group on data, Pro Bono Economics – with whom we are partnering developing the Barometer, and many other organisations including NCVO, the British Red Cross, Directory of Social Change. 
            The first current initiative that the Observatory has embarked on is the National VCSE Barometer, a quarterly national survey of VCSE organisations, backed by 14 national infrastructure organisations, with some additional funding by the Lloyds Bank Foundation, capturing near real time data about the sector. The results of the Barometer have featured on BBC One’s News at Ten, BBC Radio 4, and DCMS have stated that the Barometer was the key piece of information for the Charity Sector in England receiving £100 million in the 2023 Spring Budget.
            The second current initiative is a consultancy and co-funded PhD with Medway Voluntary Action evaluating the impact of the National Lottery funded Transformation Academy.
            The third current initiative is developing improved economic measurements of the VCSE sector to feed into how the ONS measure the sector, providing a improvements of the measurement of NPISH and the potential development of the satellite account. 
            The Observatory have also developed a KTP called the “Goodness Metric” to enable VCSE organisations to develop metrics to measure their Environmental, social, and governance and UN Sustainable Development Goals.
            The Observatory aims to have a diverse income stream including research grants, KTPs, micro-credentials, evaluations, and bespoke research based on the data. The Observatory will also be a ‘shop window’ connecting NTU to VCSE organisations.
